# Housing Affordability Crisis in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia
*A Data-Driven Analysis*
# Problem Context
Housing affordability has emerged as a critical issue in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, reflecting broader national and global trends. The rising cost of housing, combined with relatively slow wage growth, has placed significant financial strain on many residents. As a small urban center in Nova Scotia, New Glasgow faces unique challenges, including a limited housing supply, an aging population, and economic fluctuations affecting affordability. Addressing this crisis aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, which advocates for safe, affordable, and sustainable housing solutions.
# Significance of the study
The housing affordability crisis in New Glasgow has far-reaching implications. Many low and middle-income households struggle to afford housing, leading to increased financial stress and reduced spending on essential needs such as healthcare and education. Additionally, housing shortages contribute to homelessness and displacement, further exacerbating social inequalities. The crisis also impacts the local economy by making it difficult for businesses to attract and retain workers due to high living costs. Data-driven insights are crucial in guiding policymakers and stakeholders to develop sustainable solutions that address these challenges.
