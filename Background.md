# Affordable Housing for Seniors in Nova Scotia
*A Data-Driven Analysis*

# Problem Context
Senior housing affordability in Nova Scotia is a growing concern due to an aging population, rising rental costs, and limited public housing availability. Many seniors rely on fixed incomes, making it difficult to secure affordable housing. Long wait times and regional disparities further exacerbate the issue. Government programs play a role, but supply-demand gaps highlight the need for policy improvements.
This study aligns with SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, advocating for inclusive and affordable housing solutions for seniors.

# Significance of the study
Understanding senior housing affordability in Nova Scotia is crucial for addressing housing insecurity among the elderly. Limited income sources, rising costs, and inadequate public housing contribute to financial strain for seniors. This study provides data-driven insights to help policymakers and stakeholders improve housing policies, enhance funding allocations, and ensure sustainable housing solutions for aging populations.
