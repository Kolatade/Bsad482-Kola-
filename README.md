*A Data-Driven Analysis*

*By: Kolawole Amos Oguntade*

# Executive Summary
Housing affordability for seniors has become a critical issue in Nova Scotia, mirroring national trends of aging populations facing financial constraints. Many seniors rely on fixed incomes such as pensions, making it difficult to afford market-rate housing. The availability of public housing is vital to ensuring that seniors have access to safe, stable, and affordable accommodations. However, limited supply, increasing demand, and long wait times raise concerns about the effectiveness of government housing programs.
This data-driven study will analyze public housing availability, affordability trends, and government interventions for seniors in Nova Scotia. Using datasets from Public Housing Units - Nova Scotia Seniors, Municipal Fiscal Statistics, and CMHC Rental Market Data, this study aims to provide actionable insights into senior housing affordability and policy effectiveness.
